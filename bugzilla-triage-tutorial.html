  <h1>How to Triage!</h1>
        <p>Bug Triaging is the process of moving bugs logically from state to state, so they get resolved in an efficient and easy-to-comprehend manner. </p>
        <p>Go through the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?resolution=---&resolution=DUPLICATE&chfieldto=Now&chfield=%5BBug%20creation%5D&query_format=advanced&chfieldfrom=-60d&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&component=Untriaged&product=Firefox&list_id=7134104" target="_blank">bugs in the Untriaged component which have the status UNCONFIRMED</a>. Choose a bug from the list.</p>
        <p><span id="run-hint" class="hint">Refine the search to the bugs of your OS. Read the summaries to understand what the bugs might be about. This will help you choose one to triage. You can sort by OS or edit the search to create a new query. The edit search link is at the bottom of the page. Give it a try!

    </div>

    <div id="bug-chosen" class="step">
        <h1>You have chosen a bug</h1>
        <p>Read the bug. Read its summary, description, comments. Do you understand it enough that you know how to try to replicate the bug?</p>
        <span class="button" next="bug-understood">I understand what the bug is about</span>
        <span class="button" next="bug-notunderstood">I can't understand the bug</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="bug-notunderstood" class="step">
        <h1>I can't understand the bug</h1>
        <p>Leave a comment to ask for more information about the bug. You may want to use the needinfo flag. </p>
        <p> Please cc lhenry@mozilla.com on the bug, so that I know you participated in this training mission! Thanks!</p>
        <p><span id="hint-understand" class="hint">Near the end of the bug page, after the comments, there is a checkbox labelled needinfo. When you check it, you can select the bug reporter, or manually add an email address to ask a person for more information. <br>

    <div id="bug-understood" class="step">
        <h1>You can understand the bug</h1>
        <p>Check to see if the bug is a duplicate of an already existing bug. Open a new tab, and search for other bugs that use the same keywords and describe the same problem. </p
        <p><span id="hint-duplicate" class="hint">Here is a  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Screening_duplicate_bugs" target="_blank">detailed description of how to detect duplicate bugs.</a> If you're not sure if it's a duplicate, explain what you think in the comments and include the bug number of a possible dupe.

        <h1>The bug is a duplicate</h1>
        <p> Close the Bug as RESOLVED DUPLICATE. You should enter the duplicate bug number. Keep whichever bug was reported first, and has good information such as comments and attachments on the bugs. Be sure to thank the bug reporter and be polite; we want them to know we appreciate their efforts, even if the bug report is not needed. </p>

        <p>Keep on doing triaging and check if the bug needs a testcase</p>

        <p>
        <span id="hint-testcase" class="hint">A testcase can be an image, an .html page or an url depending on the specific bug. For some bugs in web pages, you can create the simplest possible page that triggers the bug. It can be handy to use a tool like <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">http://jsfiddle.net</a>.</span>
